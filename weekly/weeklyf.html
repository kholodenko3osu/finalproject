<p> This week was more relaxed for me as I started to set up the HTML of the main website and contemplate more about how I wanted to lay everything out. </p>
<p> Something that I really want to include is a cohesive narrative between all of my different website sections; maybe a message hidden within code, or something that has to be decoded/answered.</p>
<p> I have to think more about how I want to develop this narrative and how the user will interact with it. Should I add <span class="emphasis">Hidden HTML text?</span></p>
<p class="emphasis">Make the reader change the code itself?</p>
<p class="emphasis">Maybe even have them apply a style sheet to a paragraph in order to reveal a hidden message?</p>

<br>
<p> It's all really fun to think about. Ultimately, it should be relatively self-contained and accessible even to those without advanced coding knowledge.</p>
<p> This means I'll need to provide proper hints on how to access things like the HTML editor on various websites depending on how deep this goes.</p>
<p> The end goal is to create an introspective tale. The journey, the digging behind the scenes, everything should come together to make the user feel a certain way.</p>
<br>

<p> I've gotten some practice writing narratives using unique properties before. In my creative writing course this semester, I'm utilizing text formatting, overlapping dialogue, and unique paragraph structuring to hopefully make a better story.</p>
<p> All of that is being done in Word - which is both easier and harder than HTML/CSS/JS in my opinion.</p>
<p> Web creation gives you so much more freedom and control than Word; the price, of course, is knowing how to utilize that freedom.</p>

<br>
<p class="psst"> psst - is there something at the bottom?</p>

<p> Recently, I discovered an interesting short story called 17776. This story is really something that motivates me to continue learning about how to use HTML and CSS to tell a tale. </p>
<p>The tl;dr is that humanity stopped dying in 2026 and since then society has basically remained the same.</p>
<p> Humans had developed the technology necessary to make sure nobody dies and solve every problem, but people didn't want to explore the stars. Why? </p>
<br>
<p> Well, as the story puts it, you would eventually run out of resources to explore, and destroy the Earth in the pursuit of raw materials. </p>
<p> And so now everyone lives in a stagnant world, by choice. The end state of humanity is one of play.</p>
<p> Oh yeah, it's also about <span class="emphasis">football and sentient space probes</span>. You can read it <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and there's also a sequel <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/c/secret-base/21410129/20020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<br>
<p> Because the story is web-based, I decided to look at the HTML/CSS that was being used to see how other stories incorporate the languages in a creative way.</p>
<p> Whenever a character has dialogue, they are indicated with a unique text color. Each character is given a class, and their dialogue is covered in a "p" tag with the class name.</p>
<p> The relevant CSS file simply changes the color of the text and the padding, but it really helps tell a unique story.</p>
<br>
<p> The author also includes videos that are embedded into the page. I tried to copy-paste the code as it appeared on the website, but it didn't work (likely because I was missing some sort of CSS class shenanigans so it didn't display correctly).</p>
<p>So instead, I'll try to embed it on my own. Mild spoilers if you care</p>
<iframe

frameborder="20"

</iframe>
<hr>
<p> TIL that you have to add "/embed" after "youtube.com" and before the video ID to get the video to load properly. </p>
<p>At least now I know how to use it for the website portfolio!</p>

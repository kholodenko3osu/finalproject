<p> I love that you can just use style tags in html, it makes single files like this so much cooler.</p>
<p> Anyways, this week I've been working more on the interactions between JavaScript, CSS, and HTML along with making sure my GitHub was set up correctly. CSS is really a blast for customization - the poetry project gave me so many good ideas for how to combine styling and JS variables/actions. I've also learned it's incredibly rewarding to do programming with a cat purring on your lap :3 </p>
<p> This week, I'm hoping to get some more practice with JS variables to make more interesting pages. The password code I found earlier is really cool, but it doesn't work when the user presses the enter key; hopefully I can figure out how to solve that.</p>
<p> Something that I really want to learn more about in my spare time is how programming works in other countries, particularly those with non-Latin characters (think Cyrillic, Kanji, Hanzi, etc.). My understanding is that the programming language syntax/writing itself stays the same, but depending on the context variable names and other signifiers might be transliterated into the Latin script equivalent.</p>
<p> For instance, if I had a piece of text that said "the birds are chirping quietly/softly today", I can just copy-paste the cyrillic equivalent here: Сегодня птицы негромко щебечут. But if I wanted to call a variable in JS "тихаяПтица" (i.e. "quietBird"), would JS allow me? Let's test!</p>

<p>I've made a JavaScript variable called "тихаяПтица" with a value of 5, and a varaible called "quietBird" with a value of 7. If I try to recall those values, let's see what pops up below:</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div id="output"></div>
<div id="output2"></div>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Both numbers show up, which is really cool! Now I'm wondering what is considered best practice for these sorts of things. Either way, this little test is really making me enjoy the fact that HTML allows for "style" and "script" tags. It would be SOOO much harder to do this in a single HTML page otherwise!
